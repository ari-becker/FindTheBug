#Find The Bug#

Find The Bug is a programming puzzle that will be published, hopefully, on a weekly basis. The aims of each puzzle are as follows:

1. To present problematic code that encapsulates a real-world problem and thus could feasibly be mistakenly written by real people.
2. To be clear and well-readable. The challenge should come from trying to construct the program flow in your head to find the error, not from trying to decode hard-to-read code.
3. To fit the entire puzzle on one screen, so that it's easy to visualize the entirety of the puzzle.
4. To not use obscure libraries to create the problem - only language-level or enormously popular libraries.

Half the challenge is figuring out what input will produce the bug, so you should consider finding the bug by writing tests (i.e. brute-forcing inputs) to be cheating. All solutions are explained and included in a separate folder anyway.

Inspiration is taken from the weekly chess puzzles (i.e. "Find checkmate for black in 3 moves") that were published in newspapers when I was growing up. Happy solving!
